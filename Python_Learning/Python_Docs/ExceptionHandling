Exception Handling

--- Handling Errors / Exceptions during the execution of your program

--- NOTE: In Python there is no "catch" block instead it has concpet "except" 

--- Try & Except & Finally

--- Syntax:-
           
            try:
               -- code that may raise an exception
            except ExceptionType:
               -- code to handle the exception


--- We can also catch multiple exceptions by listing them in the "except" block, like this:
            
            try:
               -- code that may raise an exception
            except(ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2):
               -- code to handle the exception
