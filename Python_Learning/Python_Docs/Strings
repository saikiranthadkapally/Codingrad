1. String -- List of Characters -- Array of Characters (ORDER)
2. Strings are immutable
	name = "Manoj"
	index = position-1
	Array or List indices are started with 0
	name[0] = "m"
	strings cannot be updated.
3. String Concatenation -- Addition Operation
	a = "Manoj"
	b = "Kumar"
	c = a+b
	c = "ManojKumar"

	**** All data types in Python are objects ****
	-- Every object will have reference. ---> Location of data
	-- C language is more usefull higher control of memory management of data.
4. Substrings
	c = "ManojKumar"
	Slicing -- 
	[startIndex:endPosition]
	--- [5:10]
	substring = c[5:10]
	[:5]
	subString1 = c[:5]
	subString2 = c[5:]

5. String Exploration --- Assignment - 1
	1. Split --
	2. Strip --
	3. etc.
