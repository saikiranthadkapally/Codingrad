Till Now We Discussed:
Statistics:
    --- Attributes
        1. Numerical Attributes
            NOTE:We need not to go in deep for these "Ratio-Scaled" & "Interval-Scaled" just understand the concept for now
            1. Ratio-Scaled -- Age -- It can be performed "multiplication" & "division" 
            2. Interval-Scaled -- Temperature -- K(kelvins) -- We can perform addition,subtraction Except "multiplication" & "division"
        2. Categorical Attributes -- These below are interchanged based-on the context or situation given
            1. Binary Attributes
            2. Ordinal Attributes
            3. Nominal Attributes

    --- Distribution
            1. Normal Distribution
                1. Skewness(Right-Skewed/Left-Skewed)
                2. Kurtosis
            2. Uniform Distribution/Balanced Distribution(Balanced Data) -- Categorical Data/Attributes it should be Uniform Distribution only -- then our ML is unbiased.
            3. Imbalanced Distribution

Featuring Engineering Project -- (FEP)
    1. Feature Importance
        1. Numerical features
        2. Cat features
        3. Balanced Data/Imbalanced Data(We have to see Data Distribution)
        4. Zeros are populating/Not
        5. Same Values
        6. Outliers
        7. Duplicates, etc.
        8. Coefficient of Correlation -- R 

Project Code
        1. project Folder Heirarchy
        2. Dependencies/Modules -- PATHS Setting, Shell Scripting
        3. Utilities 
            1. Read Utils
            2. Process Utils
            3. Visual utils 

Implementation Strategy -- For our Module/Project
    1. Efficient in terms of
        1. hardware -- Here we are using "Pandas"
            1. In memory Processing -- Dataframes
            Disadvantage -- doesn't scale for bigdata in real-time industry in Pandas 
    2. Scalability 
            1. Spark -- Used to handle Scalability
    3. Availability
