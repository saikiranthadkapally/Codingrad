GitHub:
  - GitHub is a "Version Code Control System".It means Inorder to Control our "Code" Or our "Code Space" and to Store it in a good
    manner and manage our Code from GitHub.
  - It is a also called "Centralized Distribution" Let's say if any of our Friend (Or) Lecturer will Push their Code (Or) Data
    then we can Pull it from our Place.
  - A "Centralized Repository" will be stored in "Cloud". Where we can Push our Code (Or) Data.Anyone can Push the Data (Or)
    Code into it and they can Use  the Data.
  - GitHub is an "Open-Source" Every User who "SignUp" in it and then he allocated with Some Free Space like "5GB".It means
    we can store our Data (Or) Code in it Upto what free space they have Provided to Us we can Use it.

Steps to Create GitHub:
  1. Create your account in GitHub
  2. Send me your github id(If i want to add anyone as my "Contributers" then I want to add them.So,I need their github Id's)
  To Access My Team Coordinator GitHub account and Data:
    Github Notes folder:
    https://github.com/tharuncodingrad
    Clonning:
      --> ("copy of the entire repository, including all its files, code, and version history, onto your local machine. ")
    steps to follow:
    1. git clone https://github.com/tharuncodingrad/FDS-Course-2.git 
    2. dont do any updates in cloned folder(FDS-Course-2) and Don't create any "environment" in this folder..
    3. daily do this ----> git pull origin main --> This command pulls the updated GitHub Repository Data of My Team Co-ordinator Everyday to my Local Machine.
    4. SSH add to your systems
    5. Send me ur ids(I need to send My Id to my Team Co-ordinator he adds me into his Contributor then only I can access "Team Co-ordinator" Repository/Data/Code)
    6. git clone git@github.com:tharuncodingrad/DataAnalysis.git --> This should be done only when My team Coordinator sends msg as "I added to you as my Contrinutor"

Steps to follow to push updated files and folders into "Git" Repository:
  Inorder to "PUSH" daily updated files,folders and contents from "Local Machine" to "Actual Git RePository" follow these steps:
  Step-1:It moves all updated files,folders,content Except already moved files excluding "env" folder from "Local Repository(Machine)" to "local Git repository folder"
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  1. rsync -av --exclude='env' /mnt/d/Codingrad/DataScience/ /mnt/d/Codingrad/Git/Codingrad/ && cp -u /mnt/d/Codingrad/DataScience/ /mnt/d/Codingrad/Git/Codingrad/
  Step-2:Add the updated files and folders to the cloned repository:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  2. Type "git add ." and press Enter. This will add all the updated files and folders to the cloned repository.
  Step-3:Commit the changes to the cloned repository:
  ----------------------------------------------------
  3. Type "git commit -m "commit message"" and press Enter. Replace "commit message" with a brief description of the changes you made.
  Step-4:Push the changes from the cloned repository to your actual GitHub repository/Original repository:
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4. Type "git push origin main" and press Enter. This will push the changes from the cloned repository to your actual GitHub repository.That's it! Your updated files and folders should now be in your actual GitHub repository.
  ***NOTE***:These "Steps" will not "Delete" our files,folders and contents from the "cloned repository on your local machine".It only updates and sync our changes to
             cloned repository.

***NOTE***:For More Information of Basics of "GitHub" Refer the videos "Statistics Final2 and "Machine Learning Intro" from "CODINGRAD" Platform OR We also have many
