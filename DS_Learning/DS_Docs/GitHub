    Github Notes folder:
    https://github.com/tharuncodingrad
    Clonning:
      --> ("copy of the entire repository, including all its files, code, and version history, onto your local machine. ")
    steps to follow:
    1. git clone https://github.com/tharuncodingrad/FDS-Course-2.git 
    2. dont do any updates in cloned folder(FDS-Course-2) and Don't create any "environment" in this folder..
