*************************NOTE********************************: We use "StackOverflow" for debugging and for Errors while looking couple of times into it and practicing 
will improve our coding performance at initial Stage of Developer.

Project Hirarchy
    1. Dockerfiles
        Container -- It's Container basically similar to "environment" But it ia an isolated Container which will have certain Hardware(We can set Hardware to 
        Containers Where as our normal environment doesn't have separate Hardware provided to it).Container works as an another computer whereas environment
        won't do that environment is for to do experiments locally in our System.We have also some other Containers like "dev","stage" etc.. Containers.
    2. Packages
        Common
            Config
            libs
            credentials.py
            etc..
        Utils -- Mostly we use below 3 utils
            read_utils.py
            process_utils.py
            analyze_utils.py
            etc....       
        assets -- It has folders "Input", "Output" to store input & output files
           maintains files
           for development 
    3. Requirements.txt
    4. setup.sh

NOTE: WE shouldnot push our files to "GITHUB" Bcs github is a code management System Not a data management System(While we push our code into github we do gitignore)
      If we move our files cost increases as we use it by paid and also if there is any important files it will be accessible by all.leads to Security vulnerable
      and also the file "credentials.py" in common folder need not be pushed to github

    3. Path
        1. Relative Path
        2. Absolute Path
        3. setup.sh
            PYTHONPATH --- relative Path
            Appending our CWD
            NOTE:We can also do in another method such as "sys.path.append("./)" this is used in windows But it is not suggestable to use


Problem Statement: For a given CSV dataset (or) Excel dataset we need to do feature Engineering(Project)

Problem Approach:
        1. Input is CSV dataset
            --- Large
            --- Eaw dataset
            --- Lot of Problem
                -- zero values
                -- same values
                -- Data type issues
                -- Null values
                -- Lot of features 300-1000 in real-time
                -- Duplicates

        2. Output
            --- Processed dataset
            --- May be features can be reduced
            --- Alerts ---- we alert properly Bcs data generation it costs more
            --- how you fill null values/ zeros OR Data Sanitization
            --- Reporting/Report

Python Modules:
    1. Pandas
    2. Numpy
    3. Matplotlib/seaborn
    4. pyspark
    5. ydata_Profiling

Concepts:
    1. Statistics
    2. Probability Distribution
    3. Pandas Concepts
    4. Git
    
Framework:
    1. Spark

Languages:
    1. Python




NominalFeatures: It doesnot tell any information OR useful in our analysis and it doesn't maintain some order either ascending(low to high) or descending(high to low)
    NOTE:Sometimes we take NominalFeatures also into consideration based on situation.Mostly we discard it
    --- Examples -- ID, EMP_ID, NAMES, ADDRESS, PHONE_NUMBER, Martial_Status(Married,Unmarried,widow,others), Gender, Name

OrdinalFeatures: It tells some information and it maintain's some order
    --- Examples -- Status, Rating, Rank, Department

BinaryFeatures: It tells some information,it has only 2 values and also acts like a boolean
    --- Examples -- Gender,ISACTIVE

Q)what is main difference between data warehousing and database?

Data warehousing and databases are both used for storing and managing data, but they have some important differences.
A database is a collection of related data that is organized in a specific way, usually according to a pre-defined schema or structure. Databases are commonly used to 
store and manage data for specific applications, such as an online shopping website, a hospital's patient management system, or a bank's transaction processing system. 
For example, a database for an online shopping website may contain information about customers, products, orders, and payments, and the relationships between them.

On the other hand, a data warehouse is a centralized repository of data from various sources, which is designed to support business intelligence and decision-making 
activities. Data warehouses are used to store large amounts of historical data that can be analyzed and used to identify trends, patterns, and insights. For example, 
a data warehouse for a retail company may contain data from point-of-sale systems, inventory management systems, and customer relationship management systems, which 
can be analyzed to understand sales trends, inventory levels, and customer behavior.

So, the main difference between a database and a data warehouse is that a database is designed to support the operational needs of a specific application, while a data 
warehouse is designed to support analytical and reporting needs across an entire organization. In other words, a database is focused on managing and processing data for 
specific transactions, while a data warehouse is focused on storing and analyzing data to support strategic decision-making.

Q)what is main difference between data Engineering and data Analysis and data Scientists and ML Engineer and Database Administrator and Administrator relationship 
between all these  with examples?

Data Engineering:
Data engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure required to store and process large amounts of data. Data engineers develop 
and maintain databases, data pipelines, and data warehouses. They also ensure that the data is properly formatted, processed, and stored in a way that allows for easy 
access and analysis by others.

Example: A data engineer would be responsible for setting up a system to collect, process, and store data from a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter.

Data Analysis:
Data analysis is the process of extracting useful insights from data by applying statistical and analytical methods. Data analysts use tools like Excel, SQL, and 
programming languages like Python or R to analyze data and create reports or visualizations to communicate their findings.

Example: A data analyst at a retail company might analyze sales data to identify which products are selling well and which ones are not, and use this information to 
inform future product development and marketing strategies.

Data Science:
Data science is a broader field that encompasses both data engineering and data analysis, as well as other related fields like machine learning and statistics. Data 
scientists use their skills in programming, mathematics, and statistics to extract insights from data and develop predictive models.

Example: A data scientist at a healthcare company might use machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict which patients are at high risk of 
developing certain diseases.

Machine Learning Engineering:
Machine learning engineering is a specialized field within data science that focuses on developing and deploying machine learning models at scale. Machine learning 
engineers work closely with data scientists to develop algorithms and models, and then deploy those models in production systems.

Example: A machine learning engineer at a financial company might develop a fraud detection model that can identify suspicious transactions in real-time.

Database Administration:
Database administration is the process of managing and maintaining databases. Database administrators ensure that the database is running smoothly, that data is 
properly secured, and that backups are regularly taken to prevent data loss.

Example: A database administrator at a hospital might be responsible for ensuring that patient records are properly stored and secured, and that the database is backed 
up regularly to prevent data loss.

In summary, data engineering is focused on building and maintaining the infrastructure to process and store data, data analysis is focused on extracting insights from 
data, data science encompasses both data engineering and data analysis and involves developing predictive models, machine learning engineering focuses specifically on 
developing and deploying machine learning models, and database administration involves managing and maintaining databases.
