ML Automation

----> Input is Raw Dataset

   ---> Data Analysis ---> we built this module already
   ---> Output of Data Analysis ---> Good Dataset
   ---> ML Automation ----> We need to build this

       ----> Here inorder to build ML Automation we have one major tool called:
       ***NOTE***: In our course we will not cover this "Keras Tuner" bcs, its very big it consumes a lot time.So, we can learn oursel either in google or youtube.
       ----> Keras Tuner(Type and search in google) --- Hyper-parameter Tuning.Using this "Hyper-parameter" Tuning we will tune our ML Model with the keras tuner 
                                                        and we will find out the Best Model here.

       ----> Best model(Neural Network) out of this Neural Network

       ----> We can also Apply parallel after applying "Neural Network" which we got above by 
       ----> Linear or Logistic Regression models

       ----> Again,we can also apply,
       ----> RandomForestClassifier or Regressor

       ----> GridSearch is a tuner similar to Keras Tuner for "RandomForest"


       ----> After applying all these now we have to come with the,
       ----> Model Evaluation Metrics:
          ----> This will do all "Required model evaluation for each model we had built above" Like finding "scores,accuracy,loss,f1 score,precision,recall score,
                false positives,true positives, false negatives, true negatives, confusion matrix, etc...." we need to print all these "To the datascientist/User"

          To the datascientist

          ----> based on the results will decide one ML model out of it which is best

       ***NOTE***: If we do all above things as a mojor project of ML Automation then we have a lot of time to Analyse remaining models why it is not performing well. 
                   What is the problem and what statistical problem is exposed etc.. in this we have Human intervention.
       ----> Implication of Statistical Analysis of each model 

          ---> This can also be automated ---> 




----> Output is ML Model Which has been trained on Input Dataset --> Model Artifacts
