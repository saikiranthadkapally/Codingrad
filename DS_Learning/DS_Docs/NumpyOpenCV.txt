Concepts:- Discussed Till Now
--------------------------------
Hardware details & importance of hardware w.r.t Data science
Numpy:
    1. Parallel Execution
    2. Arrays
        1. scalar -- Normal numbers
        2. vector
        3. 0 dimensions -- or point dimension
        4. 1 dimensions
        5. 2 dimensions
        6. 3 dimensions
        7. n dimensions -- we have just seen "n" dimension. we also look it more in future.
    3. Representation/Visualization of Arrays.
    4. Array Slicing
    5. Basic Numpy Function
    6. Explicit Type Cast to ndarray

*** Outcome from above Concepts will be:
        -- We have to visualize atleast 3D arrays
        -- We have to very aquitance with writing dimensions for given array
        -- we should confirm that Numpy follows Vectorization & Broadcasting


OpenCV:
    1. We discussed "GPU" Execution -- Images require "GPU"
    2. OpenCV Arrays -- it means OpenCV adopted Numpy arrays -- or Numpy Arrays
    3. Colored Image 
        1. channels -- R,G,B -- Every Pixel is combination of (R,G,B) values.
    4. Preprocessing
        1. Image Reading Format
        2. Image Color Convertions & importance
        3. Normalization -- Scaling --- [0-1]
    5. Postprocessing
        1. Color Extraction -- extcolors -- extcolors will show how many distinct or diiferent colors are there in our image -- We can also implement same function from scratch.
        --- Assignment -- extracting distinct colors from an image.-- WE use "tuple set" inorder to get all distinct colors.For this if we add an extra decoration and by showing
                          it neatly then it will become a library It is like what we prepared a module from scratch.Then we don't need to use the library "extcolors".
        2. Contours for only one color --- Contours nothing but Array of points -- - Using these points we draw boarder.
        3. How to draw border 
    6. uint8 -- It's a datatype for Images,The importance of this is "Every element we have values inbetween (0-255).For these values we store in 8 bit only.We only store 
                the max value upto "255" only, for every bit.Unecessarily if we give it to 32 bit type,it's waste of memory space and no use by giving an extra space to 
                it.In NumPy we have a datatype which is supported that is "uint8".Mostly if we write any datatype for images that images will convert into "uint8" datatype 
                only by default.For Example while we finding "Contours" last time we got "True & False" right! So, When we converted this "True & False" into "uint8" then
                all True's will becomes "1" and all False will becomes "0's". These "1" and "0's" will store in 8-bit only not in 32-bits if  we store it in 32-bits we
                even can't find "Contours" also.Therefore we converted thst image into "uint8" after that we found "Contours" then the Contours which we got we have drawn
                these "Contours" on image.
